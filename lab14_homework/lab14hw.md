## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

A bachelors degree is the minimum in "in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or a related field to enter the occupation." There is a 36% job outlook, so yes, this job is growning.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

I am able to manipulate data using algorithems and analyze that data. This analysis can be done through R or through unix commands. I am also able to observe patterns in data and create graphical presentations of data.


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

My career goals is to be an MD-PHD, and with that degree I hope to be a academic surgeon. This can help me through the academic portion of my goal, as being able to neatly analyze the data and present data is usefull tool in academia.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?


Creating plots was really hard for me, becuase I approach things with a "good enough" ideology. I find finding data sets, cleaning them up, and creating functions on those data sets for analysis to be most rewarding (as It might relate to my future goals-- implementing machine learning into medicine).

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had spent more time in datastructures and algorithems/ knew more cs material. Although this class doesn't require it, I was hoping to combine this knowledge with more computationally heavy material.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I think learning how to manipulate REALLY large data sets with the unix commands would have been nice.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I do plan to pursue computer science in the future. In the short term, I plan to use computer scinece/datascience to analyze MRI scans to develope an algoritem that detects problems with MRI imagining with machine training. In the long term, I hope to use this data analysis capabilities in my lab such that I can make my research in tissue engineering more automated.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I found that struggling with my work to be THE MOST useful part of this class. This is not because I enjoy struggling, but rather I learned the most from sitting on debugging a problem. Working with students helped me debug the problems in my class that I could normally not solve by myself. An online format, for me, would GREATLY DECREASE the amount of learning I would have. This is not because I learn a lot more in the classroom atmosphere, but also because debugging becomes exponentially harder, and we wouldn't know because if it is due to some system or another case.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Yes!
